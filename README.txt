Real Bus Time Tracker

This is a project for my MIT bootcamp that follows the available bus routes along the path from MIT to Harvard.

To run this project, copy the code to your editor, and load the HTML page, and then hit the "Bus Route" button.

At some point looking to replace the marker image, as well as create a line that follows the route of the busses.
